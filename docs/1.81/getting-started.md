# Getting Started

This is a guide on getting started with Dear ImGui. It is split into 3 sections:

 1. Obtaining and building the Dear ImGui source,
 2. Integrating Dear ImGui in a new or existing application, and
 3. The basics of using Dear ImGui

Depending on your C++ and/or general programming skills, you may be able to skip certain sections/subsections.
However, **we encourage all new users to thoroughly read this guide.** Especially before asking
[thorough questions](https://bit.ly/3nwRnx1) on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues) or
[discord server](http://discord.dearimgui.org/).

First, let's start with [Obtaining and building the Dear ImGui source](getting-started/building.md).
